=head1 NAME

Set::Relation::V2 - Bundled second implementation of Set::Relation role

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Set::Relation::V2 version 0.13.3 for Perl.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See the SYNOPSIS of L<Set::Relation>, which represents this file also.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Set::Relation::V2 provides the second complete implementation of the
Set::Relation role, following L<Set::Relation::V1>, and it does not
implement the Set::Relation::Mutable role.  This newer version is the one
you should be using in practice, rather than the older one, since it should
have better performance.

There are 2 main differences that Set::Relation::V2 has from
Set::Relation::V1.  The first is that V2 provides immutable objects while
V1 provides mutable objects.  The second is that V2 is lazy and will defer
any tests for duplicate tuples as late as possible, while V1 is eager and
will test for duplicate tuples as early as possible; V2 will also respect
true C<$allow_dup_tuples> arguments, while V1 will ignore them.  Besides
those 2 matters and their associated large differences in performance
profiles, V2 is essentially the same as V1, including that relation tuples
are internally represented by Perl Hashes.

=head1 INTERFACE

Set::Relation::V2 composes the Set::Relation role declared in the
L<Set::Relation> file.
